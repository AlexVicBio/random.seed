This database comprises 1000 entries of meteorological data collected from a weather station in the United States. 
The dataset includes measurements of precipitation, temperature, and soil humidity recorded over a span of 10,000 days. 
Each entry contains information about a specific day, detailing the corresponding values for precipitation (in millimeters), temperature (in degrees Celsius), 
and soil humidity (as a percentage). The dataset is structured to facilitate statistical analysis in R, allowing exploration of temporal patterns, correlation assessments among variables, 
and investigations into the long-term trends of these meteorological parameters.
